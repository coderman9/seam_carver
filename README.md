First things first: this is an implementation of [this](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall14/cos226/assignments/seamCarving.html), which I originally was pointed to by [this](http://nifty.stanford.edu/). Fun! Thanks to both parties for making these publicly available.

TODOs
---
1. Figure out the complexity and expected run time. Right now, for a 600 px square image, it takes quite a non-trivial amount of time. Should this be so?
2. If the runtime does not match the complexity (or has larger lower-order terms than expected), optimize!
